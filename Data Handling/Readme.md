Day 12 to Day 22 focus on data handling and data processing projects.

These projects involve working with real-world data formats such as CSV and JSON, along with data visualization using Matplotlib.

The aim of this phase is to strengthen data manipulation, analysis, and visualization skills by handling structured datasets, extracting meaningful insights, and presenting data in a clear and visual manner.

Together, these projects enhance practical understanding of data workflows and prepare a solid foundation for advanced data analysis and machine learning tasks.
