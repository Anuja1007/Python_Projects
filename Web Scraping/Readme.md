Day 23 to Day 32 focus on web scraping projects.

During this phase, projects involve extracting data from websites using tools such as Requests and BeautifulSoup, understanding HTML structure, and handling real-world web data.

These projects help develop skills in data collection, automation, and working with unstructured data.

Overall, this stage strengthens practical problem-solving abilities and builds a strong foundation for data analysis, automation, and real-world data-driven applications.
