This folder contains a collection of basic yet practical projects that reflect real-life use cases and everyday problem-solving.


The projects were completed over a period of 11 days, from Day 1 to Day 11, following a consistent learning and development approach.


Each project serves a unique purpose and focuses on different concepts, tools, and techniques, helping to build a strong foundation while gradually expanding practical and technical knowledge.


Together, these projects demonstrate hands-on learning, consistency, and the ability to apply theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios.
